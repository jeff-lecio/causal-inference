# Causal Inference Learning Plan

This repository contains a structured, integrated study plan for advanced causal inference methods. The core curriculum is based on Cyrus Samii’s NYU course, and is supplemented by key materials from:

- Possebom’s Microeconometrics lecture notes (FGV)
- Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham’s Applied Empirical Methods (Yale)
- Josh Merfeld’s Applied Microeconometrics (KDI)
- Matheus Facure’s “Causal Inference for the Brave and True” (Python tutorials)

## Structure

- `notes/`: Weekly notes and summaries by topic
- `code/`: R and Python implementation examples
- `data/`: Datasets used in practical exercises
- `references/`: Lecture notes, syllabi, and readings
- `project_final/`: Optional applied project combining multiple methods

## Goals

The project aims to consolidate both traditional and modern approaches to causal inference, with a balanced focus on:
- Theoretical foundations (e.g., identification, IV, DiD, RDD)
- Applied econometrics and statistical intuition
- Machine learning tools for causal analysis
- Hands-on experience using R or Python

Weekly notes and examples are based on an 7-week structured progression.
